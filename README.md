# Marvel 3D Element Project

Just finished this front-end training by adding a Marvel-themed 3D element ⚡️❗️

## Overview

For the first page, I’m using Three.js, react-three/drei, and react-three/fiber to create a truly marvelous effect 😍. This is the kind of effect I’ve been dreaming about for a long time, and it’s incredibly satisfying to see it come to life and achieve what I set out to do. 

👀 If you want to see a preview for yourself, you can check out the link provided.

## Features

### Events
I’ve introduced a direction-aware hover effect using Framer Motion to enhance the user experience. Each interaction is designed to be fluid and responsive, making the site feel lively and engaging.

### Characters: Raindrop Design
Allow me to introduce Raindrop 🌧️! In this design, each card is shaped like a raindrop, featuring a red gradient border. I've added a parallax effect to each drop individually, creating a unique visual experience.

☄️ When you hover over a drop, it either displays a glare effect if there’s no image or a pop-up showing the title and description if there is one.  
📱 The entire design is fully responsive and works seamlessly on mobile devices.

### Comics Section
🦸‍♂️ I’ve also added animations in the hero section to make it more appealing. It features several components that I discovered and customized: a 3D card effect, a card hover effect, and a grid/dot background. More design ideas are in the works.

### Series : Another design 🎆 ❗️

A direction-aware hover effect using Framer Motion.

## Technical Implementation

⚡️ Additionally, I used ShadCN/UI for the search bar, pagination, and dark mode.  
🛠️ To fetch data, I integrated the Marvel API and built a mini router. This project is developed with Tailwind CSS and Next.js.  
💡 I also implemented a custom debounced hook to prevent excessive requests, optimizing the performance of the application.
